# Project in TMA4320: Introduction to Scientific Computation.
## Project 2: Engineering Physics

Introduction:

In this project we examine the rolling behavior of a ship by modeling it as a long half-cylinder. With a given mass and radius of the model semi-cylinder we can calculate common ship parameters (metacentre, centre of buoyancy, etc.) and then simulate the ships rolling behavior based on given initial conditions. In the first part of the project we assume the buoyancy to be constant for a simplified model. In the second part we recalculate the buoyancy together with the other forces at each step, later adding in a frictionless transversally sliding point mass on the deck, simulating the behavior of our model with and without a railing preventing the mass from sliding off deck. In this project we mainly used the RK4 method to solve the differential equations of the model system numerically, and plotted the roll and heave of the ship.
